AHSE,Arts Hum Soc Sci Entrepr,The Human Connection: Tools and Concepts from Anthropology for Understanding Today's World,AHSE1145,"The book Wired to Care opens with the story of a designer who disguised herself as an elderly person to better understand the experiences of the elderly in our society. Author Dev Patnaik explains his interest in this experiment. It comes down to empathy: All of this is to reclaim a very old idea, that quantitative data and facts are no substitute for real-world experience and human connection. Anthropologists have long-argued for the importance of putting oneself in other people shoes for better understanding. The anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski wrote in 1922 that the goal of the anthropologist is ""to grasp the native's point of view, his relation to life, to realize his vision of his world."" In this course, students will try out the anthropological methods of participation, observation, interviews, and analysis of cultural materials and texts. This is a hands-on course for students who want to get out and meet people all with the aim of greater understanding. The course focuses on three thematic topics important to our society in the twenty-first century. Past offerings have focused on aging, religion, health, and globalization. The class includes assignments, events, and interactions that will take students off campus (perhaps to the Needham Senior Center, local coffee shops, and to Boston's ethnic neighborhoods) and will include visitors from area institutions.",,,4 AHSE,,,,,,,4-0-8

AHSE,Arts Hum Soc Sci Entrepr,Identity from the Mind & the Brain: Who Am I and How Do I Know,AHSE1155,"Perhaps the most fundamental question any developing individual asks himself/herself is: Who am I? The ways we answer this question have evolved over the course of history as the dominant ways of knowing (epistemologies) have shifted. Indeed, the question of how we come to know ourselves has captivated Western scholars since the days of Descartes, but a look at the last fifty to sixty years has also seen enormous changes. Many people invoke psychological and philosophical perspectives in describing their identity, focusing on their personality, their developmental history, and their place in society. But the explosion of neurobiological research has introduced a new and viable outlook: explaining identity at the chemical and electrical level of the brain. There is good reason to think that these different perspectives on identity are mutually exclusive and this tension will underlie everything we discuss in this interdisciplinary course. Indeed, when it comes to a topic as fundamental to human existence as identity, it is absolutely essential to wonder not only ""who am I?"" but to also ask ""how do I know?"" In this course, we will approach the question of identity from multiple perspectives, including psychology, postmodern philosophy, and neuroscience. In the process, we will critically examine not only the conception of identity that each perspective supports, but also the assumptions and limitations of each epistemology. This course focuses more on the science of psychology and neuroscience, while AHSE 1150: What Is ""I""? is more focused on philosophy and artificial intelligence.",,,4 AHSE,,,,,,,4-0-8

Students will also draw subjects from life, i.e. stationary objects and life models using media including charcoal, graphite, conte, and ink. The emphasis will be realistic depiction as compared to non-objective abstraction. Students will begin with basic exercises in drawing and rapidly move to more complex intensive drawing experiences. Approximately one-third of the classroom time will be used for drawing from a life model. Class discussion and sketchbook homework assignments will be an essential element in the learning process. Homework assignments will include drawing and visual thinking exercises to be completed in personal sketchbooks. Reading selected text material is also part of the homework requirement. Several invited speakers will contribute to the course and provide informal critiques of student work. One field trip is planned to the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University in Cambridge to view art. Other in-class activities will include participation in discussion of drawings (old master and contemporary) that are presented to illustrate various objectives of classroom work (e.g. use of line to indicate form) and group critique sessions.

This course will draw equally on empathetic and ethnographic methods and on a technical understanding of the problem and solution domains. Over the semester, we will learn about and with our clients; we will identify specific challenges that our clients face; and together with our clients we will develop concrete solutions to address these challenges.  Students will leave Engineering for Humanity with a grounded understanding of the engineering problem solving process, experience in participant-observer fieldwork, and hopefully a feeling of satisfaction at having made a concrete difference in the lives of members of our community.  <br /><br /><br /><br />The projects will be specific service projects that students identify and design while working with senior citizens in surrounding communities. For example, students might design a device to help someone who has difficulty reaching up to change a light bulb, something to help hold a newspaper steady with shaky hands, or something to enable someone to get clothes out of a clothing dryer that is difficult to stoop down to reach. Some sessions of the course will be devoted to co-design with the client population or to team meetings.

SCI,Science,"Metals, Mining, and the Environment",SCI1420,"This course explores materials science through the lens of metallic materials and their environmental and social impacts. From iron and aluminum in mechanical structures, to cobalt and rare earth metals in electronics and renewable energy applications, today?s technologies rely on metals and alloys for their unique physical and chemical properties. Metals are part of a larger technological system, however, with complex social, environmental, political, economic, and ethical implications. Through a series of projects, students in this class will explore the technical processing, microstructure, and behaviors of metallic materials, while researching and discussing sustainability issues related to mining operations, raw material processing, and recycling and disposal. We will critically examine the social and environmental costs of the metals industry and metallic products, and consider our professional and ethical responsibilities as scientists, engineers, designers and global citizens to address larger problems or initiate positive change. The course takes place in a studio-laboratory setting, where teams will implement self-directed project plans guided by their own interests and goals, apply a range of materials testing and analytical techniques, and produce a range of project deliverables that reflect an interdisciplinary understanding of metallic materials and their impacts. <br /><br />",,,4 SCI,,,,,,,6-0-6
SCI,Science,Plastic Planet,SCI1430,"This course explores materials science and solid-state chemistry through the lens of plastics and their environmental and social impacts. The world is creating plastic materials at a staggering rate, with annual global production approaching 400 million tonnes. While plastics play critical roles in health, food packaging, transportation, and construction, the exponential demand for plastics raises significant questions about the human and ecosystem impacts of polymeric materials. For example, only small fractions of plastics are recycled, and recent policy shifts have left many countries struggling to manage their plastics waste streams. Through a series of self-directed team projects, students in this class will explore technical and contextual issues related to plastics processing, use, and disposal, such as the rise of single-use plastics, toxic chemicals and pollutants from polymer synthesis, biodegradation and recycling, life-cycle assessment of plastics versus alternative materials, and larger systemic challenges associated with the plastics industry. The course takes place in a studio-laboratory setting, where teams will implement and troubleshoot project plans, apply a range of materials testing and analytical techniques, and conduct research and reporting that enables critical thinking and reflection on the benefits and consequences of plastics technologies. <br /><br />",,,4 SCI,,,,,,,6-0-6
