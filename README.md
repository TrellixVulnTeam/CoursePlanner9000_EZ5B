# Course Planner 9000

## Description

Course Planner 9000 is a simple web application that allows students to visually map out their four year course schedule at Olin. Current course and academic major information is spread over different websites, which make navigating the different graduation requirements difficult and time consuming. Course Planner 9000 simplifies this process by aggregatting graduation requirements, course times, and course credits and displaying the information in an interative and understandable way.
